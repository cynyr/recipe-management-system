This has been dropped by me in favor of gourmet (http://sourceforge.net/projects/grecipe-manager/).
After using(trying to use) Gourmet I found it unsatisfatory, I decieded that what I really want is a
standards compliant website that allows downloading PDFs. 
The reason for the web based UI:
    - lots of devices have web browsers.
    - Ultimitly I would like to have this system running on a touchscreen in my kitchen
    - The current trend towards internet tablets should make the cost of such a system cheaper.

A recipe management system writen in python/django.

The old code was python/gtk.
